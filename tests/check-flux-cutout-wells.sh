# A sector cut out of the full model as a grid of its own usually keeps only
# its own wells in its SCHEDULE section. The wells outside it still produce and
# inject in the parent, still count towards every group and field total, still
# take their share of a group target, and a UDQ over them still has a value.
# The FLUX file carries their rates and says which group each is in and whether
# it produces or injects, and the reduced run adds them to its schedule without
# connections, so that all of that carries on as in the parent.
#
# This parent has P1 in the sector, and P2 in the same group outside it with an
# efficiency factor, and I1 outside it as the only well of a group the sector
# deck does not have. The sector deck lists P1 alone. G1's target is shared
# between P1 and P2, so P1's own rate is only right if P2 takes its share, and
# the UDQs read P2's rate and bottom-hole pressure and sum over all wells.
